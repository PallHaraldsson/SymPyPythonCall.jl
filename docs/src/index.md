# SymPyCall

Documentation for [SymPyCall](https://github.com/jverzani/SymPyCall.jl).

[SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) is Python library for symbolic mathematics.

[SymPy.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/SymPy.jl) is a `Julia` package using `PyCall.jl` to provide a "`Julia`n" interface to SymPy.

[SymPyCall.jl](https://github.com/jverzani/SymPyCall.jl) is a `Julia` package using `PythonCall.jl` to provide a "`Julia`n" interface to SymPy providing a nearly identical experience as `SymPy.jl`.

This package started as a proof of concept to see if `PythonCall` could be used to make `SymPy.jl` either faster or easier to maintain. It may prove useful as an alternative, given the ease to install additional python packages provided by `PythonCall` and its ecosystem.
